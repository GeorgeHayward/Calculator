# Calculator
Implementation of a desktop calculator. 

What i learned implementing this calculator (so far):
- Introduction to JavaFX. Using buttons / setting a scene.
- Parsing mathematical syntax correctly.
- An understanding of the ShuntingYard Algorithm... The one used is currently a place holder, I want to code my own math parser.

To do:
- Better UI design, create background etc with graphics.
- Expand the amount of operators and functions to meet the programmer calculator on Windows.
- Write my own math parser
